In `r maxyr`, NOAA Fisheries' Alaska Fisheries Science Center conducted two surveys within U.S. territorial waters of the Bering Sea: the eastern Bering Sea Shelf bottom trawl survey and the northern Bering Sea bottom trawl survey. This is the `r nth_yr$val[nth_yr$srvy == "EBS"] ` year of the eastern Bering Sea survey and the `r nth_yr$val[nth_yr$srvy == "NBS"]` year of the northern Bering Sea survey using consistent sampling methods and protocols. A rapid response survey for the northern Bering Sea region was also conducted in 2018 and will not be covered here. The northern Bering Sea survey region contains `r haul_cruises_maxyr$stations_avail[haul_cruises_maxyr$srvy == "NBS"] ` stations in an area bounded by the Bering Strait, Norton Sound, and the U.S.–Russia Maritime Boundary (Fig. \@ref(fig:fig-survey-points)). While the northern Bering Sea region has been surveyed occasionally in the past, 2010 is considered the start of the modern series because it was the first year the region was sampled using the same standardized sampling methods as the eastern Bering Sea shelf survey.

NOAA has identified the northern Bering Sea area as a region of critical importance for increased scientific monitoring because this marine ecosystem may be rapidly altered by climate change. This survey represents one part of an extensive research plan to design a long-term time series that identifies and tracks the environmental and ecological change throughout the Bering Sea. Beyond the potential impacts of climate change, the scale and extent of fish and crab movements may also vary from year to year in response to many biological or environmental processes. These movements cause changes in distribution and abundance that extend beyond the traditional survey boundaries (e.g., eastern Bering Sea) and ultimately create an additional need for survey data that provide comprehensive coverage of the entire Bering Sea. 

In this document, we provide some of the results of the `r maxyr` northern Bering Sea survey and compare these to observations from the `r text_list(nbsyr[nbsyr != maxyr])` surveys. The results of the `r compareyr` survey can be found in the `r compareyr` Data Report `r paste0("[",ref_compareyr,"]")`. Detailed information on bottom trawl survey results for commercial crab species are discussed and analyzed in the AFSC Shellfish Assessment Program's annual data report `r paste0("[@SAPcrab",maxyr,"]")`. In the future, continuation of this survey effort in the form of a combined eastern Bering Sea and northern Bering Sea bottom trawl survey will provide more comprehensive information to investigate how fishes, crabs, and other bottom dwellers respond to biological and environmental changes on a large spatial scale over a multi-year time period.
