Summary results for `r xunits(sum(!is.na(report_spp$order[report_spp$taxon == "fish"])))` abundant fish and `r xunits(sum(!is.na(report_spp$order[report_spp$taxon == "invert"])))` invertebrate taxa caught during the `r SURVEY` surveys are presented below. Plots of biomass and abundance time series, spatial distribution, abundance-at-length estimates, and stratum-level CPUE (kg/km^2^ and no/km^2^) tables are provided for each taxa. The spatial distribution maps are presented as inverse-distance-weighted interpolations of CPUE (kg/km^2^), which uses a weighted average of nearby measured stations to estimate values at unmeasured locations between stations. Similar interactive maps of these highlighted taxa and others are available through the NOAA Distribution Mapping and Analysis Portal (https://apps-st.fisheries.noaa.gov/dismap/; @DisMAPDataPortal). More information on how to find, download, and interact with the data used to produce this report is available in the [Data Sources](#data-sources) section. Taxa are presented in alphabetical order by common name.
