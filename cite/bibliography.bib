Throughout the period, benthic fauna was dominated by sea stars (48–78\\%), followed by cods (5–19\\%), flatfish (5–15\\%), sculpins (1.5–7\\%), and crabs (2–6\\%). From 1976 to 2002, the cpue index of total species increased exponentially (4.5\\% y−1) by threefold with some declines in 1991 and 1999. The increase was also observed in sea stars (5.1\\% y−1), flatfish (6.1\\% y−1), and crabs (2.5\\% y−1). However, trends of cods and sculpins were mixed. Regression analysis showed the cpue index of total species to be positively correlated with survey years and bottom-water temperature. However, bottom-water temperature, when considered by itself, was not significant. Results suggest that regime shifts caused biomass increases of Norton Sound epifauna and demersal fish.}",
